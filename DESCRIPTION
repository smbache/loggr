Title: A Logging Framework for R
Version: 0.3
Author: Stefan Milton Bache
Maintainer: Stefan Milton Bache <stefan@stefanbache.dk>
Description: The logging mechanism introduced by loggr is flexible and allows
  for capturing both classic R conditions (simpleError, simpleWarning,
  simpleMessage) and other log events, and for specifying multiple logging
  devices (files and the console) each of which may listen for different
  events.
